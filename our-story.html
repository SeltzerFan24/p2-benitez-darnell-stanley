        <h3>Our Story...</h3>
        <p>The Florida Ocean Alliance is a nonpartisan organization dedicated to bringing together the private sector, academia,
        and nonprofit research organizations in Florida to protect and enhance Florida’s coastal and ocean resources for
        continued social and economic benefits. Recognizing the interconnection of Florida to its neighbors in the Caribbean
        Basin, along the Gulf of Mexico, and the Atlantic Coast, the Florida Ocean Alliance is committed to positioning Florida
        as an international leader to integrate ocean conservation, education, and responsible economic development. Private
        sector members include representatives from ocean-related industries in tourism, ports, shipping, cruising, recreational
        and commercial fishing, and recreational boating. Other members include representatives from nonprofit research
        organizations, academia, the ocean research community, and public interest groups.</p>

        <p>The Alliance serves as a clearinghouse for information on key ocean and coastal issues facing Florida. It monitors and
        publicizes actions related to the oceans and coasts. The Alliance focuses on outreach and educational activities for the
        public and policymakers, including conferences, papers on ocean and coastal policies, economic studies, and testimony to
        national or state agencies and commissions concerned with ocean or coastal policy. Each year the Alliance sponsors
        Florida Oceans Day in the State Capitol in Tallahassee.</p>

        <p>The Alliance was formed in late 1999 and evolved from the members participating in the Florida Governor’s Ocean
        Committee. This group recognized the vital role of coastal and ocean resources to Florida’s quality of life and economic
        vitality in their 1999 Final Report.</p>
