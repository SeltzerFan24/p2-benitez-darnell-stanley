Adv Web 2, Project 2: Florida Ocean Alliance Redesign


Ezra's Notes:
I worked on index.html and its styling, as well as implementation of the Windy Webcam API.

I had the most trouble with getting the API operational. It wasn't too difficult after completing the first API assignment, but I still relied on stack overflow and the API documentation to help with various aspects. I asked a programmer friend for help with error troubleshooting, which generally involved minor changes to characters in the JS.
