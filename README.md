Adv Web 2, Project 2: Florida Ocean Alliance Redesign


Ezra's Notes:
I worked on index.html and its styling, as well as implementation of the Windy Webcam API.

I had the most trouble with getting the API operational. It wasn't too difficult after completing the first API assignment, but I still relied on stack overflow and the API documentation to help with various aspects. I asked a programmer friend for help with error troubleshooting, which generally involved minor changes to characters in the JS.

Jenny's Notes:
I worked on membership.html as well as the pop-up window and hamburger menu.

I had issues with the hamburger menu. I was struggling towards the end when I would click on the links. The hamburger menu would disappear and the links would remain exposed. Basically what was happening was the desktop nav was replacing the hamburger menu when I clicked on it. I used Dev tools to see what was happening.
It was a super simple fix, I just had to flip the desktop nav and hamburger menu placements.
